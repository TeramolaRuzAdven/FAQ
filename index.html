                    JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement 
                    complex features on web pages — every time a web page does more than just sit there and display 
                    static information for you to look at — displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, 
                    animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes.

                <h3>Is it easy to learn HTML and CSS?</h3>

                <svg width="15" height="10" viewBox="0 0 42 25">
                    <path d="M3 3L21 21L39 3" stroke="white" stroke-width="7" stroke-linecap="round"/>

                <p>
                   HTML and CSS are partners that work together to create web pages.
                   And while they might be team mates, HTML and CSS visually look
                   different, and they function differently too. So while you'll have
                   to learn both it's easy to learn HTML and CSS together at the same 
                   time. They aren't hard.

                   Web development is the building and maintenance of websites, it's 
                   the work that happens behind the scenes to make a website look
                   great, work fast and perform well with a seamless user experience.
